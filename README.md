# The Last City On Earth
A 3D demo created with OpenGL 3.3, which later evolved into a rendering engine with various graphical effects and a simple game built on top of it.
<br />
The purpose of the game is to defend the city from incoming so-called UFOs. Unfortunately for you, it is not possible to  succeed in this game. 
The only thing you can do is to keep the shield alive for as long as possible. Difficulty also increases over time, so if you manage to survive more
than 3 minutes you can consider yourself good.
